# 📊 Loan Approval Classification and Analysis (R)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a loan dataset and building a classification model to predict loan approval status. The work includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification using R.

## Dataset Features
The dataset contains attributes such as:
- Person income  
- Employment experience  
- Home ownership  
- Loan amount  
- Loan intent  
- Interest rate  
- Loan percent of income  
- Credit history length  
- Credit score  
- Previous loan defaults  
- Loan approval status (target variable)

## Work Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling missing and invalid values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Outlier detection and treatment  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Loan approval classification modeling  

## Tools Used
R • RStudio • Data analysis and visualization libraries

## Project File
The main analysis is contained in:

`loan_approval_analysis.R`

This script performs data preprocessing, analysis, and loan approval classification.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in RStudio  
2. Load the dataset into R  
3. Run the script `loan_approval_analysis.R`
